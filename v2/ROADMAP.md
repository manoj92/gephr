# Implementation Roadmap

## Phase 0 – Foundations (Week 1)
- Install Flutter 3.27+, set up melos workspace, configure shared analysis rules.
- Bootstrap CDK app and deploy baseline networking + auth stacks in AWS dev account.
- Integrate CI (GitHub Actions) for lint, format, test, and CDK synth checks.

## Phase 1 – Authentication & Shell (Weeks 2-3)
- Implement Cognito hosted UI + native flows (email/password, OAuth providers).

- Create user profile management endpoints and UI.

## Phase 2 – Capture Pipeline (Weeks 4-6)
- Integrate multi-camera capture using platform channels for MediaPipe hand tracking.
- Add calibration wizard, real-time overlays, and session metadata capture.
- Implement offline-first storage (Isar) and background upload workers to S3.
- Backend Lambda for ingesting media, storing metadata (DynamoDB), and triggering processing Step Functions.

## Phase 3 – Review & Annotation (Weeks 7-8)
- Build session review UI with timeline scrubbing and keyframe tagging.
