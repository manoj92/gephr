## 🛡️ Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## 🌐 Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This includes:
- GitHub repositories and discussions
- Discord community server
- Social media channels
- Conference presentations and workshops
- Research collaborations
- Robot demonstrations and public events

## 🚨 Reporting Guidelines

please report it by contacting the community team at:

📧 **conduct@humanoidtraining.dev**

All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality.

### What to Include

When reporting, please include:
- Your contact information
- Names (real, nicknames, or usernames) of any individuals involved
- Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing
