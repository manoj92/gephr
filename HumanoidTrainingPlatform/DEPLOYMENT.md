eas build --platform ios --profile production --clear-cache
```

#### Android Build Failures
```bash
# Check permissions in app.json
# Verify package name matches Google Play Console
# Check Android SDK versions
```

#### EAS Build Issues
```bash
# Check build status
eas build:list

# View specific build logs  
eas build:view [BUILD_ID]

# Cancel stuck builds
eas build:cancel [BUILD_ID]
```

### Environment Issues
- Ensure all required environment variables are set
- Check API endpoints are accessible
- Verify authentication tokens are valid
- Test on physical devices before release

## üì± Testing Strategy

### Pre-Release Testing
1. **Unit Tests**: `npm run test`
2. **Integration Tests**: Test robot connectivity
3. **E2E Tests**: Test complete user flows
4. **Device Testing**: Test on multiple iOS/Android devices
5. **Performance Testing**: Test with large datasets
6. **Security Testing**: Penetration testing and security audit

### Beta Testing
1. Use TestFlight (iOS) and Internal Testing (Android)
2. Recruit beta testers from target audience
3. Collect and analyze feedback
4. Fix critical issues before public release

## üöÄ Release Process
